# Event-Management-tool
UniEvents is a dynamic event management platform designed to simplify how university students and organizers connect through campus events. It enables student clubs and departments to create, manage, and advertise events, while allowing students to browse and register for upcoming activities based on their interests.

The platform is built with a responsive frontend using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScrip**t, ensuring accessibility across devices. The backend is powered by **Node.js** and **Express.js**, handling core functionalities like user login, event creation, and registrations. All data is stored securely using **MongoDB Atlas**, a flexible NoSQL database that supports scalable and schema-friendly event records.

UniEvents features a role-based login system, where only registered users can access the platform. Organizers can create and manage events, while students can enroll, view details, and filter events by category.
A mock payment integration simulates real-world enrollments, and enrolled data is stored in the database for organizers to track.
With clean UI design and a robust backend, UniEvents delivers a seamless experience for managing everything from technical hackathons to cultural nights. All backend services are currently hosted and run locally, while MongoDB provides cloud-based data access for development.

Whether you're organizing or attending, UniEvents brings university events to your fingertips â€” efficiently, securely, and in real time.
